The fitness module gives all the cost functions required to calculate 
the schedule fitness. In particular, it comprises 4 main functions:

1. calculate_fuel_costs()
2. calculate_start_costs()
3. calculate_constraint_costs()

The lost load costs are calculated from the energy not served (ENS) which
is taken from the economic_dispatch function ().
